    Slack / Hazard
------------------------------------------------------------------------------}
-- | The \"slack or hazard\" represents the distance between
-- a reference point in (time, probability) space
-- and a given 'DeltaQ'.
--
-- * 'Slack' represents the case where the 'DeltaQ' __meets__
--   the performance requirements set by the reference point.
-- * 'Hazard' represents the case where the 'DeltaQ' __fails__ to meet
--   the performance requirements set by the reference point.
--
-- Both cases include information of how far the reference point is
-- away.

    -- Specifically, we have 'Duration' at the same probability as the reference,
    -- and 'Probability' at the same duration as the reference.
    | Hazard (Eventually (Duration o)) (Probability o)
    -- ^ We fail to meet the reference point.

    -- we overshoot by 'Duration' at the same probability as the reference,

-- retryOverlapN n dt = retryOverlap (replicate n dt)

-- | Retry an outcome multiple times, take the first instance that succeeds.
--
-- More specifically, @retryOverlap dts o@ models the completion times
-- of a race of @length dts@ independent copies of the outcome @o@
-- against each other, succeeding when any of the copies first succeeds.
--
-- Each copy is started after a timeout
-- in the event that the previous copies have not finished yet;
-- the list @dts@ gives the successive timeouts.
--
-- If no copy succeeds within total time @sum dts@,
-- the whole outcome fails.
